# About Resources

This file will explain what the different resources are and where they come from.

## blocks.json, items,json, language.json

These files are from [https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-data](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-data).

## mapColors.json

Map color data contains the colors of various blocks when they appear on maps. Currently, the data I've pulled contains
a block for every color except for the color corresponding to water.

The map color data is taken from [MapartCraft](https://rebane2001.com/mapartcraft/).
You can find my repository for extracting the data here:
